# Leetcode Examples using Rust

Learning a new programming langauge is both fun and challenging. Being a long time python programmer, I decided to challenge myself with learning Rust. I have attempted to code some leetcode examples using Rust, and educating myself on learning best practices while programming Rust.
Hopefully you could leverage examples and templates used in this repository to make your development/learning experience better! Happy Coding in Rust!
